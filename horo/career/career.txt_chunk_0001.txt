# A beautiful find near the 24th could be the opportunity to expand or add to your career in some way but use caution if spending or 'competition of/with a coworker' is involved
* A beautiful opportunity may present itself near the 31st to 2nd BUT remember to 'go through proper channels' and to make sure you do not violate anyone's ego, power position or status/appearance when you do so
# Your ESP is in tip-top shape and you'll need it nears both the 20/21st and the 23rd
# A big help of some kind can unfold near the 20th and the 24th in what are easily unrelated but similar situations
# A long talk with what appears to be 'an insider' may give you useful direction near the 21st to 23rd and off site smoozing the 24th really pays off
# Then there is another connection of some kind linked to it the 7/8th; a 'first meeting' or a second move and if you hit that one, you may be a 'lock for sure'
# A more emotional happiness with coworkers and bosses is indicated near the 23rd when 'they may finally get it', and hear your need that has gone unheeded lately
# A big mistake near the 4/5th can be born out of a very 'impractical choice' so do make sure you run it through the paces before acting on it, research back ground into and/or bounce it off a pro before investing time/effort and reputation
# Avoid taking on any 'higher ups', bosses, important clients or powerfully placed people near the 10th; you'll lose and lose BIG if you try
# An inside connection of some kind may come from a 'low level' placement of some kind that proves to be more 'high level' resulted the 18th
# Keep a ball rolling the 19th and avoid allowing personal time or events to invade your career space
# Hit problems head on near the 18th but stall with any you encounter the 21st until you can find the right solution
# A big problem near the 29th can be averted with a sound discussion; pick info out of the right brain! An unusual request is likely the 30th but if it 'breaks any rules' or carries any risk say NO! Avoid a gossipy or over emotional coworker near the 1/2nd and do NOT be seen as 'part of any unhappy or complaining group' of people
# Finish early the 3rd but only after double checking you have answer or addressed ALL communications!
# A big project near the 12to th 14th may require you polish image very carefully and make sure you are represented exactly as you desire
